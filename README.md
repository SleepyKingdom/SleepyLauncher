# SleepyLauncher

Minimal Prototype of a Minecraft modpack launcher built with React, Vite and Electron.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires network access):

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite and Electron together.
